Various processing scripts for diddling pixels.




Disclaimer: I am not a programmer. These tools were cobbled together hastily as a short side project. I don't know what I'm doing. If you have suggestions for improving my poorly organized and probably suboptimized code, ok, but I'm probably off doodling something else and won't listen. I doubt I'll be here often.
